Fluorescence microscopy, a widely utilized method for visualizing cellular structures, faces a challenge in maintaining consistent 
image quality due to the absence of a standardized statistical guideline. Denoising algorithms have been created to overcome the 
obstacles of setting  image aquisition parameters to produce high quality images without generating phototoxicity. However, these tools have not been 
thoroughly tested for their effeciency. The following programs are part of a research project that aims to test a denoising AI
algorithm and determine an appropiate general guideline for the aquisition of high quality fluorescence microscopy images.
