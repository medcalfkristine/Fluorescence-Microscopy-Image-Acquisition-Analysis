Fluorescence microscopy is a widely used technique for visualizing cellular structures, but it faces challenges in maintaining consistent image quality due to the lack of standardized statistical guidelines. To address this, various denoising algorithms have been developed to optimize image acquisition parameters, aiming to produce high-quality images while minimizing phototoxicity. However, the effectiveness of these tools has not been thoroughly evaluated.

This project focuses on testing a denoising AI algorithm and establishing appropriate general guidelines for acquiring high-quality fluorescence microscopy images. The analysis includes both nucleus and mitochondrial fluorescence microscopy images. The repository contains all code for data preprocessing, algorithm evaluation, and result visualization.

Note: Due to data privacy and the sheer amount of data, the raw image data used in this project cannot be included in this repository.
